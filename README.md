How to play the shortest course given 6 holes on each set of three tees?

An interesting optmiization problem. In a "pick 6" golf tournament you are required to play 6 holes from each set of 3 tees (starting points). Total of 18 holes 6*3. Each set of tees (Gold, Blue, Black) make a hole shorter to longer, in that order. Given that you must play all 18 holes and must choose 6 holes from each set of tees. What would be the tee selection on 18 holes that would give the shortest total 18 holes?
